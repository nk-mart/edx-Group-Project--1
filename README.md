# edx-Group-Project--1


## Overview
In this Project, we will be using the various concepts learnt to execute a design that solves real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. With the use of our coding knowledge, this activity will presents a page with multiple functionality. 

With the share of knowledge, strength and ideas from fellow developers, our task is to create an application which will enable a user
to select their flight trip as well as choices of entertainment within their journey period. 

The Web-Page will includes a description of its functionality and expected to be user-friendly in appearance and navigation.


## Instructions

1.We will construct a rigid criteria as well as user story to meet the expected functionality of the website. 
2. Once we have come up with project idea we will be creating a new GitHub repo called “edx-Group-Project--1”
and clone it on the GitHub repository
   
4.Our data will largely depend on the APIs data collected and with our collaborative coding technique, we will create a user friendly function and a response which will enable the acquired data to function as expected by writing a JavaScript code that would analyzes and reformat the API data collected.

## Technology being used for the project
HTML
CSS (Bootstrap)
JavaScript

## Collected data should function as follow;
* Enable user to select a flight journey.
* Enable user to understand the time duration for their journey.
* Enable user to select a movie which will fit in with the time duration of the selected trip.

User story

A user requires an application which would allow the individual to prepare in advance a choice of a movie within the time-length of their flight. A user would prefer to use the Web-App to complete their choice of flight as well as their choice of movie during their trip as this would safe them time and reduces the possible chance of anxiety during flight.
